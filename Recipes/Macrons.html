    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>Macarons are delicate French cookies made from almond flour, egg whites, and sugar, filled with ganache, buttercream, or jam. They are known for their smooth, glossy shells and chewy texture.</p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup almond flour</li>
        <li>1 3/4 cups powdered sugar</li>
        <li>3 large egg whites</li>
        <li>1/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>Pinch of salt</li>
        <li>Food coloring (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Instructions</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 300°F (150°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, sift together almond flour and powdered sugar to remove lumps.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, beat egg whites until frothy, then gradually add granulated sugar while continuing to beat until stiff peaks form.</li>
        <li>Gently fold the dry ingredients into the egg whites until well combined. If using, add food coloring at this stage.</li>
        <li>Transfer the mixture to a piping bag and pipe small circles onto the prepared baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Let the piped macarons sit for about 30 minutes to form a skin.</li>
        <li>Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until the shells are firm and can be lifted off the parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Allow to cool completely before filling with your choice of ganache, buttercream, or jam.</li>
        <li>Sandwich two shells together with the filling and let them rest in the refrigerator for a few hours to allow the flavors to meld.</li>
    </ol>
