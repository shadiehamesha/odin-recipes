    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This waffle recipe is the only one you'll need to make homemade waffles with your waffle iron. Simple pantry ingredients mix up quickly in this easy batter that can be used right away or stored in the refrigerator for up to a week.

        <li>1 3/4 cups milk</li>
        <li>1/2 cup vegetable oil or melted butter</li>
